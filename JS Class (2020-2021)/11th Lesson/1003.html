            Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers. 
            Many students define paragraphs in terms of length: a para
            graph is a group of at least five sentences, a paragraph is half a page lon
            g, etc. In reality, though, the unity and coherence of ideas among sentences is what constit
            utes a paragraph. A paragraph is defined as “a group of sentences or a single sentence that forms a unit” (Luns
            ford and Connors 116). Length and appearance do not determine whether a section in a paper is a paragraph. For instance, in some style
            s of writing, particularly journalistic styles, a paragraph can be just one sentence long. Ultimately, a paragraph is a sentence or grou
            p of sentences that support one main idea. In this handout, we will refer to this as the “controlling idea,” because it controls what happens in the rest of the paragraph.
